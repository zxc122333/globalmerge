The `d.ts` in `project/node_modules/@merge/*/dist` is hand wrote by me, and the original generated by TSC live in the comments.

The problem is in the `project/src/index.ts` file.

```typescript
import * as Plugin from '@merge/plugin';

Plugin.sayHelloToPlugin({foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar'})


// This should fail at compile time, but it pass
Merge.sayHelloToCore({foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar'})
```
